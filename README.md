# VM Events Demo
This demonstration consists of two parts: (1) a script running on the virutal machine that queries for new events on a scheduled basis and relays any detected event to an endpoint (via HTTP POST) and (2) an endpoint that receives event data and sends an email notification to a designated administrator.

## Script
